# Kotwiser

Code-folds kotlin bitwise infix functions into their C-style operator equivalents. This is purely visual and does not modify source code, operator precedence, etc.

Only K2 mode is supported (although K1 may still work).

Please report any issues on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sophmi/kotwiser/issues).

| Function | Operator |
|----------|----------|
| shl      | \<\<     |
| shr      | \>\>     |
| ushr     | \>\>\>   |
| and      | &        |
| xor      | ^        |
| or       | \|       |
