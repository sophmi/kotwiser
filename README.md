# Kotwiser

Code-folds kotlin bitwise infix functions into their C-style operator equivalents. This is purely
visual and does not modify source code, operator precedence, etc.

Only K2 mode is supported (although K1 may still work).

| Function | Operator |
|----------|----------|
| shl      | \<\<     |
| shr      | \>\>     |
| ushr     | \>\>\>   |
| and      | &        |
| xor      | ^        |
| or       | \|       |
